## Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Wandero-ai/wandero.git
cd wandero
```

---

## What You'll See

Your view depends on GitHub permissions:

| Access | Folder | Contains |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **ALL** | `wandero/` | Overviews, public docs |
| **TEAM** | `wandero/team/` | Processes, playbooks |
| **ADMIN** | `wandero/team/admin/` | Records, PII, financials |

If `team/` is empty → user lacks TEAM access. This is expected.

## After Setup

2. Start with `_index.md` files in each domain
3. Ask user what they need help with
